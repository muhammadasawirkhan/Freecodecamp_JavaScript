Ensure that you are editing the inside of the lookUpProfile() function.
This function includes two parameters, firstName and prop.
The function should look through the contacts list for the given firstName parameter.
If there is a match found, the function should then look for the given prop parameter.
If both firstName and the associated prop are found, you should return the value of the prop.
If firstName is found and no associated prop is found, you should return No such property.
If firstName isnâ€™t found anywhere, you should return No such contact.*\
